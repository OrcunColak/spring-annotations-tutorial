# Goal

This is a demo project for Spring Boot Annotations

# @DependsOn

Original code is from  
https://towardsdev.com/dependson-annotation-in-springboot-ed173bbd64f8


# @ResponseBody

Original code is from  
https://medium.com/javarevisited/spring-boot-annotations-controller-restcontroller-difference-explained-with-practical-example-813e9d0ce11a

When using @Controller annotation we have to use @ResponseBody annotation on every handler method if we need to return
XML or JSON data.
